# Kubuntu Post-Install Script WIP
A custom Post-Install script for Kubuntu that I use to get systems up and running quickly.
This script is only meant to be used by me, but feel free to use it if you like it.

Download theses plasmoids while the script runs: 
Latte Separator,
Latte Spacer,
Window Title Applet,
Better Inline Clock
